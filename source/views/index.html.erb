    <h1>Have you always wanted to create a C64 game or demo?</h1>
    <p>Everyone tells you there are plenty of books you can dig through and forums you can follow.<br>If only you had time for that...</p>

    <p>What if I told you there is a better way?</p>

    <h2>The easiest way to start programming Commodore&nbsp;64</h2>

    <p>Imagine that <strong>every week</strong> you make a <strong>small step</strong> toward your goal. You watch a short video, play around with code examples and read show notes.<br>
    In couple of weeks from now you'll have a solid understanding of a lot of BASIC, assembly and Commodore 64, and will be so much closer to your goal.</p>

    <p>And the best part?</p>

    <p>It will be <strong>effortless</strong>.</p>

    <h2>This is what 64 Bites is all about.</h2>

    <p>I'm reading those books, tutorials and forums so you don't have to. I'm working hard to give you exactly what you need to achieve your goal. </p>
    <ul class="pros">
      <li><strong>Each week</strong> you'll get a short, ~5-minute <strong>video</strong> covering a small bit of <strong>BASIC</strong>, <strong>6502/6510 assembly</strong> and the architecture of Commodore 64.</li>
      <li>Along with the video you'll receive a <strong>complete transcript</strong> of the episode, <strong>source code</strong> examples and additional show notes.</li>
      <li>You'll also get access to all previously released episodes.</li>
      <li>You can <strong>watch them online</strong> on any device or <strong>download</strong> for your convenience <strong>DRM free</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
