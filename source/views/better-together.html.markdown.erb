## 64bites is a series of Weekly C64 Programming Video Tutorials

There are already <%= episodes_catalog.all_episodes.count %> Video Tutorials published on a variety of topics.

Each one with a full transcript. Plenty of source code and programming exercises.

You can already learn a variety of topics, ranging from simple stuff in BASIC to opening the borders and displaying more than eight sprites in a pretty advanced Assembly.

## But it's time to make it even better.

I am working hard to make it **the #1 best place to learn about Commodore 64 in the world**.

And I need your help to do that.
