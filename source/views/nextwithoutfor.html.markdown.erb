# Oh! A fellow retro-computing enthusiast! 

Interested in **Commodore 64**?

Well, in that case, I have something for you...

## A gift from the 64bites project

64bites is a series of **short**, **focused** and **deep video lessons** that can teach you to **program Commodore 64**!

Each lesson takes just **five minutes** to watch and it **respects your time**.
<br>It can easily **fit your busy schedule**. 

Each one focused on explaining a **single thing in depth**.
<br>I spend long hours, researching, testing recording and compressing the knowledge, 
<br>so **you can learn it in the most efficient way**.

Videos come with **full transcript**, **source code**, and **exercises**. 



In other words, each video is **a tasty bite of C64 knowledge**.
<br>It brings you closer to **finally writing that game and demo**. 

The series starts literally from **basics of BASIC** but quickly transitions into the **assembly**.
<br>
This is where **the real fun happens**.

If you ever desired to create **games or demos for Commodore 64** I can help you get started.
