## Get Season 2 - Foundations of Assembly for just $9.99 (that's 50% off)!

Learn foundations - arithmetics, comparisons, logic, jumping and subroutines.

Top that with **automated testing**.

Season 2 will open the door for more advanced and **even more exciting topics**.

I know you'd happily jump straight into 

- **opening borders**, 
- displaying **64 sprites** at once, 
- playing **SID music** or 
- rendering **hires bitmaps**.

**You will learn** those soon enough. 

But first **master the foundations**.

**For half the price!**
