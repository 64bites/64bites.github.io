The Commodore 64 can display images with the maximum resolution of 320 by 200 pixels.
But we only learned how to fill the screen with 256 different characters at most. This works great as tile-based graphics for games but to draw images we want to have a way of drawing each pixel independently.
To do that we need to learn how to use bitmap modes that VIC-II can display.

The one we will learn today is called the High-Resolution Bitmap Mode.
