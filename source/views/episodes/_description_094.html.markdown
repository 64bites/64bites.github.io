Aren't you tired of counting cycles in your routines by hand?

Looking up specifications of every single instruction gets old soon.

It's especially hard if your code contains branches and loops.

Not to mention page crossing. 

Wouldn't it be great to have the cycle-count computed automatically?

In this tutorial, we are going to create a library.

You'll be able to include it in any project.

It will automatically compute how many cycles your routine takes.

We won't need to look up specifications of every single instruction.

We will also make sure the library works well by using Test Driven Development to create it.
