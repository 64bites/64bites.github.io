When programming Commodore 64 we are using different representations of numbers.

Sometimes it is more convenient to use a plain old decimal version, especially when we need to use any arithmetic.

But when we operate on specific bits of a number it is easier to use a binary representation.

Memory addresses, on the other hand, are more natural to read as hexadecimal numbers.

In the source code, we can easily change the representation of a number.

But we don't have any built-in way of printing them on the screen.

Today we will solve this problem.
