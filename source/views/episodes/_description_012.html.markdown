### The player has been hit by the monster...

90 points of damage has been inflicted.

What happens next?

Maybe the shield was destroyed. Or even the player has been killed...

We won't know for sure until we figure out how to program IF STATEMENTS in assembly...

#### This episode WILL teach you that!

You will learn how to:

* effectively make 'if statements' in assembly
* trigger C, V and N flags
* use BCS, BCC, BVS, BVC, BMI and BPL instructions


And you will find out if the player has been killed ;)
