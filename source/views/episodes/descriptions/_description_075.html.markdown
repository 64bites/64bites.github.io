In this episode we will learn how to use basic features of the C64 Debugger.
Memory map allows us to quickly notice patterns in the running program. 
Disassembly view allows us to locate the program counter and modify the code on the fly. 
Memory dump view can help us edit raw data and shows memory as sprite or character bitmaps.
Finally we get familiar with status views of VIC-II, SID and both CIA chips.
