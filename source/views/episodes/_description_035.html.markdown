In the previous episode, we've seen how to optimize the memory usage of the sprite animation with a technique called run-length encoding. It allowed us to keep only a unique subset of all bitmaps in the memory. In effect, we managed to shave off almost 2KB of RAM.
But we needed to calculate indices and repetition counts of unique frames by hand. Today we will use the compilation time metaprogramming to automate that process.
