<%= image_tag "promotions/the-commodore-story.jpg", alt: "The Commodore Story - Poster" %>

**This means you are a fantastic human being, interested in keeping the retro-computers alive!**

The two-hour long documentary will take you through Commodore's evolution.
It will hopefully inspire you to create your own productions.

To make that easier, I've prepared a gift for you!

## A gift from the 64bites project

64bites is a series of short video lessons that can teach you how to program The Commodore 64!

Each episode takes just 5 minutes to watch, so it can easily fit your busy schedule. Videos come with full transcript, source code, and exercises. Each one focused on explaining a single thing in depth.

In other words, each video is a tasty bite of C64 knowledge that brings you closer to finally writing that game and demo. The series starts literally from basics of BASIC but quickly transitions into the assembly, where the real fun happens.

If you ever desired to create games or demos for this fantastic machine. I can help you get started.

## Get the first nine episodes for free!

As a backer of the 'The Commodore Story - Changing the world 8-bits at a time' you can download the Season 1 package for free.
