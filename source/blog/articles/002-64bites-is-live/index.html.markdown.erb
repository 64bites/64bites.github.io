## What is the 64 Bites anyway?

It's a series of short weekly videos that are designed to teach you programming the Commodore 64 in small, logical steps.

Each episode is about 5 minutes long (so you will find a time to actually watch it). Videos are self-contained focus on a small "bite" of programming knowledge. 

You can browse the list of <%= link_to "all episodes", "/episodes/all" %> and even watch <%= link_to "some of them", "/episodes/free" %> for free.

## Why does it start from scratch?

The series is designed to teach anyone C64 development. Even people who haven't had any experience with 8-bit computers. 
Therefore first few episodes focus on BASIC. It is available as soon as you turn the computer (or the emulator). BASIC is also easy to use and powerful to make few interesting things with it.

Although the series starts with relatively basic concepts (pun intended), seasoned veterans will most likely find an interesting thing or two in each episode. Each video delves pretty deep in the technique described.

## Will it cover advanced stuff?

Starting from Episode #007 we'll jump straight into the assembly language and we will mostly stay with it later in the series.

We will cover more advanced topics like sprite multiplexing, opening borders, interrupts in the future.

To make the learning as painless as possible, the series has been organised in a logical order. For example we will learn about raster interrupts and scrolling before we open the borders.

## What is the early bird discount?

Normal price for 64bites subscription is $11/month or $110/year (that's two month for free).

However, during the first week after the launch, to honour early supporters I'm offering an 18% discount.

In other words, until **Thursday, 18th June 2015** you can get the subscription for only:

* $9/month or
* $90/year (two months for free).

And this is for life! This means that even if the prices are raised in the future you will pay the lower early bird price until you end your subscription.

You will most likely never find a better deal on 64bites again.
