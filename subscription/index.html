Looking up specifications of every single instruction gets old soon. It's especially hard if your code contains branches and loops. Not to mention page crossing. Wouldn't it be great to have the cycle-count computed automatically? In this tutorial, we are going to create a library. You'll be able to include it in any project. It will automatically compute how many cycles your routine takes. We won't need to look up specifications of every single instruction. We will also make sure the library works well by using Test Driven Development to create it. </div> <div class=poster> <img class=thumbnail src="../assets/images/episodes/094.jpg"/> </div> </div> <div class="episode free"> <div class=info> <h2>Episode #093 - Sprites everywhere</h2> Can we display more than 8 sprites on the screen with side borders open? Of course, we can! You'll learn how in less than eight minutes! </div> <div class=poster> <img class=thumbnail src="../assets/images/episodes/093.jpg"/> </div> </div> <div class="episode free"> <div class=info> <h2>Episode #092 - Sprites on the border IV - Four on a bad line</h2> In the previous episode, we've found a way to display sprite-zero while also having the side border open. In this video we will figure out if that's possible on a bad line. </div> <div class=poster> <img class=thumbnail src="../assets/images/episodes/092.jpg"/> </div> </div> <div class="episode free"> <div class=info> <h2>Episode #091 - Sprites on the border III - Eight sprites</h2> In this episode, we will learn how to display sprite zero while the side border is open. This allows us to draw all eight sprites on the top and the bottom part of the border where there are no bad lines. </div> <div class=poster> <img class=thumbnail src="../assets/images/episodes/091.jpg"/> </div> </div> <div class="episode free"> <div class=info> <h2>Episode #090 - Sprites on the border II - Seven sprites</h2> In the previous episode, we have learned that if the sprite is to be displayed on a next raster line the graphical chip steals five cycles from the processor. That's not the whole story, though. Not all of those five stolen cycles are equal. The number changes depending on which sprites are currently active. Today we will try to figure out the required delay for up to seven sprites. </div> <div class=poster> <img class=thumbnail src="../assets/images/episodes/090.jpg"/> </div> </div> <div class="episode free"> <div class=info> <h2>Episode #089 - Sprites on the Border I</h2> Now that we have the border open around the whole screen, we can finally use that space to draw something. We can use sprites to do that. But having them enabled with the side border open is actually quite hard. Today we will see how to display them on separate raster lines. </div> <div class=poster> <img class=thumbnail src="../assets/images/episodes/089.jpg"/> </div> </div> <div class="episode free"> <div class=info> <h2>Episode #088 - Hyperscreen</h2> In this episode we will learn two methods of opening all borders around the screen. The effect is also know as hyperscreen because it allows to expand the drawable area and increase the screen resolution. </div> <div class=poster> <img class=thumbnail src="../assets/images/episodes/088.jpg"/> </div> </div> <div class="episode free"> <div class=info> <h2>Episode #087 - Opening Borders III - Almost There</h2> In the previous episode, we've started opening side-borders. It went fine until weencountered a bad line, which left us with fewer cycles to spare. Today we will tackle that problem and try to open the rest of the border. </div> <div class=poster> <img class=thumbnail src="../assets/images/episodes/087.jpg"/> </div> </div> <div class="episode free"> <div class=info> <h2>Episode #086 - Opening Borders II - Left & Right</h2> In the episode sixty-one, we've learned how to use the vertical border expansion to remove parts of the border that are above and below the drawable area. Opening side borders can be accomplished in a similar fashion, but it is significantly harder. Not only the timing has to be spot-on, the process has to be repeated on each raster line. </div> <div class=poster> <img class=thumbnail src="../assets/images/episodes/086.jpg"/> </div> </div> <div class="episode free"> <div class=info> <h2>Episode #085 - Raster Stabilization IV - Pitfalls</h2> We've been working on a raster stabilization routine for three episodes already. We ended up with an optimized code that does the job quite well. But I've also been warning you about difficulties in writing timing specific code. Today we will explore the topic, and try to break our routine deliberately. </div> <div class=poster> <img class=thumbnail src="../assets/images/episodes/085.gif"/> </div> </div> <div class="episode free"> <div class=info> <h2>Episode #084 - Raster Stabilization III - Optimization</h2> Once we have our stable raster routine working it's time to optimize it. Let's see if we can minimize its memory footprint and shave off few cycles here and there. </div> <div class=poster> <img class=thumbnail src="../assets/images/episodes/084.jpg"/> </div> </div> <div class="episode free"> <div class=info> <h2>Episode #083 - Raster Stabilization II</h2> In this episode we continue stabilization of the raster. All we need to do is solving two problems: * find out a way to detect if we are one cycle early and then * delay the execution by just one cycle only in this situation. The former can be solved by comparing current rasterline register value at the right moment. Once we know that we need to just find an instruction that can take a variable amount of cycles. But how to do it in practice? </div> <div class=poster> <img class=thumbnail src="../assets/images/episodes/083.gif"/> </div> </div> <div class="episode free"> <div class=info> <h2>Episode #082 - Raster Stabilization I</h2> Because of the way the 6510 processor works the raster interrupt handlers might experience a random delay in execution. The variance is usually called the jitter and it can take up to seven or even eight cycles. In this episode we will learn how to reduce the jitter to only one cycle consistently using two nested interrupts. </div> <div class=poster> <img class=thumbnail src="../assets/images/episodes/082.gif"/> </div> </div> <section class=buy> <div class=buy-button> <p>You can get the subscription for $10.99/month or $109/year (two months for free).</p> <a class=button href="https://gumroad.com/l/64bites">I want a new episode each week!</a> <p>Get <strong> 13 latest episodes now</strong> and a <strong>new one each week</strong>.<br>All with <strong>detailed transcripts</strong>, <strong>source code examples</strong> and <strong>programming exercises</strong>.</p> <div> </section> </main> <footer> <span> Copyright © 2014-2017 Creative Mind - Michal Taszycki </span> </footer> </div> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.1.min.js"></script><script src="../assets/javascripts/application.js"></script> <script>
