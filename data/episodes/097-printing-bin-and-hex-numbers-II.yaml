  In the previous episode, we've created pseudo commands that converted numbers into their binary and hexadecimal string representations.

  They will work fine in most cases when we need to either print the string directly to the screen or store them in the memory.

  But sometimes we might prefer to have print commands that would use the KERNAL's character output routine.

  This way we wouldn't need to care about the screen coordinates and have the number printed at the current cursor position.
