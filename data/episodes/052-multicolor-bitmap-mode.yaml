  The Multicolor Bitmap mode is the last of built-in graphical modes that Commodore 64 can display.

  As the name suggests, it can display bitmap images with additional colors, but it sacrifices the horizontal resolution.

  In the hands of a talented artist it can be used to create colorful and beautiful images.
