description: "Often in programming Commodore 64, we need accurate and compact delay
  loops. \n\nWe usually create them using one of branching instructions.\n\nOnce we
  introduce such loop, our code can become fragile, since branches can take one cycle
  more if the jump lands on a different page than the next instruction.\n\nAnd it
  can happen by accident if we add some code to before those instructions or if we
  relocate the program.\n\nThis can lead to frustrating debugging sessions since the
  compiler doesn't warn us about this problem automatically.\n\nToday we will change
  that."
