description: In the previous episode, we've seen how to optimize the memory usage
  of the sprite animation with a technique called run-length encoding. It allowed
  us to keep only a unique subset of all bitmaps in the memory. In effect, we managed
  to shave off almost 2KB of RAM. <br> But we needed to calculate indices and repetition
  counts of unique frames by hand. Today we will use the compilation time metaprogramming
  to automate that process.
