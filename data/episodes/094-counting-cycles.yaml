description: "Aren't you tired of counting cycles in your routines by hand?\n\nLooking
  up specifications of every single instruction gets old soon.\n\nIt's especially
  hard if your code contains branches and loops.\n\nNot to mention page crossing.
  \n\nWouldn't it be great to have the cycle-count computed automatically?\n\nIn this
  tutorial, we are going to create a library.\n\nYou'll be able to include it in any
  project.\n\nIt will automatically compute how many cycles your routine takes.\n\nWe
  won't need to look up specifications of every single instruction.\n\nWe will also
  make sure the library works well by using Test Driven Development to create it."
