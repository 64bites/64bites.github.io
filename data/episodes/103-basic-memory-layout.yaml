  When we turn the Commodore 64 on it greets us with an information about how many bytes are free for BASIC programs.

  But not all of it can be used for the code.

  As soon as we introduce variables, arrays or do operations on strings the interpreter needs to allocate memory for them as well.

  Today we'll take a closer look at the memory layout of BASIC programs, and what happens when the program grows.
