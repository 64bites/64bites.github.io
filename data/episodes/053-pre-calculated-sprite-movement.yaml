description: "We have been animating sprites in the past but only in a way of changing
  their bitmaps on each frame. But this kind of animation is not unique to sprites.
  It can also be realized using the character graphics. \n\nSprites are designed to
  be movable and today we will take a look into a technique that allows them to follow
  virtually any path."
