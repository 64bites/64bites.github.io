  It's about time to figure out how to use the SID chip without a pre-built player.

  In this video we will learn how to use one of the built-in oscillators to generate different kinds of sound waves.

  We are also going to find out why a particular bug in the chip (the one causing a click when volume is changed) became a desirable feature.
