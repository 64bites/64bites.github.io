  Although efficient, hardware screen scrolling forces us to widen the border, which in turn leaves us with only twenty-four rows or thirty-nine columns of characters.

  In a case of vertical scrolling, we also don't have an easy way to make the rest of the screen static.

  Fortunately, we can sacrifice some efficiency, and use the custom character set to scroll twenty-five characters vertically.
