  When Commodore 64 came out, it was produced mainly for two different markets.

  The one for the USA market was designed for the NTSC system, while the European model supported PAL.

  Each one had a different internal clock, specified in cycles per second. They also differed in the total number of raster lines and the amount of cycles it took to display one.

  Why don't we play music on both of them!
