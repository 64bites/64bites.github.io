description: In our previous episodes, we've been using a quite primitive animation
  technique. We've been simply advancing frames in an infinite loop with and wasting
  enough time with a delay macro to slow the animation down. <br> Not only we don't
  have an easy way to control the exact speed of animations using this technique.
  But the amount of delay needs to be updated whenever we add or remove any code to
  run in this loop. <br> Fortunately there is a different way. And I'd like to use
  this opportunity to introduce one of the most exciting features of the 6510 processor
  that powers the Commodore 64 - the interrupt handling.
