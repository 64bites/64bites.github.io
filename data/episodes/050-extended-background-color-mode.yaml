  The last of built-in character modes that the Commodore 64 can display is an extended background color mode.

  It allows us to combine high-resolution graphics with additional colors but sacrifices the amount of characters that we can choose from.

  In the hands of a skilled artist it can give your game a unique look that cannot be replicated in different modes.
