  The processor that powers the Commodore 64 supports only a handful of registers that can be used for arithmetic or logical operations. This means that we will often encounter a situation when we need to save temporary values in the memory, calculate some other thing, and then get back to previous ones.

  We can use store and load operations for that purpose. But it requires allocating memory for temporary variables.

  Fortunately, there is a better way...
